# UTDRM: Unsupervised Method for Training Debunked-Narrative Retrieval Models

This repository contains the models and code for [UTDRM](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00437-y), an unsupervised method for training debunked-narrative retrieval models. The approach involves generating topical claims using T5 and ChatGPT claim generators and training the dense retrieval model using MNR loss.

## Usage Instructions:

1. **Generate Claims:**
   - Utilize the T5 and ChatGPT claim generators located in the `generators/` directory to generate claims.

2. **Convert Dataset and Mine Hard Negatives:**
   - Convert the dataset into BIER format and mine hard negatives using the scripts available at [GPL](https://github.com/UKPLab/gpl). This process will generate the `hard-negatives.jsonl` file.

3. **Train the Model:**
   - Find the script for training the dense retrieval model using MNR loss in the `training/` directory.

## Best Performing Models:
